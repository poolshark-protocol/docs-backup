# Directional Range Orders

Using the previously announced concepts, a `Directional Range Order` puts together `Range Orders` and `Directional Liquidity` in order to have specific LP price ranges for orders in single-sided asset pools. 

### Main benefits

- Significant slippage reduction
- Mitigation of `Impermanent Loss` outside of the assets' inherent price volatility
